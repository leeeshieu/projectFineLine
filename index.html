                <h1>General</h1>
                <p>Fine Line is the second studio album by English singer and songwriter Harry Styles, released on 13 December 2019 by Columbia and Erskine Records. Preceded by three singles "Lights Up", "Watermelon Sugar" and "Adore You", Fine Line debuted at number three on the UK Albums Chart and number one on the Billboard 200, making it Styles' second consecutive number-one album in the US. The album had the third-largest sales week of 2019 in the US and broke the record as the biggest debut from a British male artist since Nielsen SoundScan began. It was also the first number one on the Billboard 200 in the 2020s. Fine Line has been described as rock, pop and pop rock, with elements of prog-pop, psychedelic pop, folk, soul, funk and indie pop.</p>
                <h1>Background</h1>
                <p>In an interview with Rolling Stone released on 26 August 2019, it was reported that the singer was putting the "final touches" on his album which Styles explained was "all about having sex and feeling sad." The album was also described to contain his "toughest, most soulful songs he's written yet." On the direction of his second album, Styles revealed he wanted to be more fun and adventurous compared to his first, Harry Styles. Styles further acknowledged using psychedelic drugs during the recording process.</p>
                <h1>Promotion</h1>
                <p>Shortly before release, the single "Lights Up" was promoted by billboards and the caption: "Do You Know Who You Are?" in several cities around the world. The song was released on 11 October 2019 as the lead single of the album. Styles officially announced the release of Fine Line on his social media on 4 November. On 2 December, Styles revealed the trailer for the album's third single, "Adore You", which was narrated by Spanish superstar Rosalía. The song and music video were released on 6 December. Styles promoted the album on the 16 November episode of NBC's Saturday Night Live as both a host and a musical guest. Styles collaborated with Spotify to organize a fan-exclusive event held in an undisclosed location in Los Angeles for a private listening party, where fans were taken to experience Eroda, an elaborate theme created for his single Adore You. To celebrate the release, Styles held a one-night-only show at The Forum in Los Angeles that coincided with the album's December 13 release, followed by another show at the Electric Ballroom, London on 19 December with special guest Stormzy. The album will be promoted with Love On Tour.</p>
